# Human-readable Time Intervals

The time intervals in this library can be provided as a `number`
in milliseconds **or** as a human-readable time interval.

Below are a few  examples:

  - `1 ms`
  - `5 days`
  - `3 minutes`
  - `10 hours`
  - `30 seconds`

There are also a few supported abbreviations (either can be used):

   - `ms`
   - `sec` -> `second`
   - `min` -> `minute`
